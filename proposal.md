# Proposal
I would like to make a game where you can draw something out and be able to "raise" it like a pet. Players would be able to get in-game currencies from the pet gifting some to you at certain intervals and the in-game currency will also eventually be able to be gained from mini-games.

## Needs to Have
- At least one mini-game
- Create classes (for mini-games or for the pet itself)
- Player input (text for pet name and drawing for the pet appearance)
- Currency variables
- In-game shop to use currency on
- Bars for the pet's state (ex. hunger, thirst, etc)
- Player interaction with pet
- Basic sound effects + music, and basic UI

## Nice to Have
- Pet can occasionally try to interact with the player (random speech bubbles?)
- Save files
- Multiple pets
- More mini-games
- Animations
- Random/surprise events
- Pet likes/dislikes
- Make it mobile-friendly?
