# Proposal
I would like to build off of my tic tac toe game (the bunny game). I would like to build it so that the tic tac toe game is not the only thing that is available to do (so the board should not take up the entire screen). I'd like to add a scoring system where the more you win, the more you get in-game currency to buy stuff from the shop, and the player can choose which team to side with. I'd like to add more mini-games like bunnies trying to catch carrots from the sky.
I would also like to add a player character that the player can name and purchase cosmetics from the shop with in-game currency. 

## Needs to Have
- Tic-tac-toe game
- Classes (carrots falling from the sky)
- Scoring system
- Currency + shop
- Player text input

## Nice to Have
- Introductory storyline
- More mini-games
- A lobby of sorts where the player can run around with their character
- NPCs that the player can interact with
- Savefiles
